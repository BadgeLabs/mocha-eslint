[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]


A simple way to run [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) in your [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) tests without a task runner like Grunt or Gulp.

Inspired by [mocha-jshint](https://github.com/Muscula/mocha-jshint) from
[Allan Ebdrup](https://github.com/Muscula).

## Installation

You can install into your node.js project as a development dependency with:
```
$ npm install --save-dev mocha-eslint
```
Mocha-eslint will install ESLint for itself, so you don't need to worry about adding it to your consuming module.

The same is not true for Mocha.  You should already have Mocha installed in your consuming module.

*Note: verison 1.0.0 of this project uses eslint 1.0.0.  Read the [migration guide](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/migrating-to-1.0.0) to learn what you need to do for the upgrade, but the main thing is that ESLint will no longer provide rules by default, you'll need to set them explicitly or extend from a shared config.*

## Usage

After mocha-eslint is installed, you can use it by creating a test file for
Mocha and requiring mocha-eslint like so:
```
var lint = require('mocha-eslint');
```
This will return a function with the signature:
```
lint(paths, options)
```
where `paths` is an array of paths from your project's top level directory
(as of v0.1.2, you can also include [glob patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer))
and `options` has a single property `"formatter"` which can be assigned to the
name of any of the
[ESLint formatters](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/tree/master/lib/formatters)
("stylish" (the default), "compact", "checkstyle", "jslint-xml", "junit" and
"tap") or the full path to a JavaScript file containing a custom formatter.  If
`options` is not included, the default "stylish" formatter will be used.

So, a full test file to run in Mocha might look like:

```
var lint = require('mocha-eslint');

// Array of paths to lint
// Note: a seperate Mocha test will be run for each path and each file which
// matches a glob pattern
var paths = [
  'bin',
  'lib',
  'tests/**/*Test.js',
];

// Specify style of output
var options = {};
options.formatter = 'compact';

// Only display warnings if a test is failing
options.alwaysWarn = false; // Defaults to true, always show warnings

// Run the tests
lint(paths, options);
```

## Notes

This module does not make any decisions about which ESLint rules to run. Make sure your project has a .eslintrc file if you want ESLint to do anything. As of version 1.0.0, no rules are enabled by default.
